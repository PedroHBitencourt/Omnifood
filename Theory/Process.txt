The process Behind Building a website

#01 - Define the project

-Define WHO the website is for.
-Define WHAT the website is for. (define business and user goals)
    -Business Goal Example: Selling premium dog food
    -User Goal Example: Finding high-quality dog food for good price
-Define a target audience. Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website (this can come from your client)
    -Example: Women, 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning over 2000â‚¬/month, with a passion for dogs

#02 - Plan the project

-Plan and gather website content: copy(text), images, videos etc.
-Content is usually provided by the client, but you also can help them produce and find some content 
(simply finding free images is easiest, but if they wanto copy, charge them extra)
-For bigger sites, plan out the sitemap: what pages the site needs, and how they realted to one another (content hierarchy)
-Based on the content, plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order
-Define the website personality (See web design section)

#03 - Sketch Layout and Component ideas

-Think about what components you need, and how you can use them in layout patterns (Get inspirations in web design section)
-Get ideas out of your head: sketch them with pen and paper or with some design software (Figma, Adobe UX)
-This is an iterative process: Experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution
-You don't need to sketch everything, and don't make it perfect At some point, you're ready to jump into HTML and CSS

#04 - Design and Build website

-Use decisions, content and sketches from Steps 1,2 and 3 to design and build the website with HTML and CSS ("designing in the browser")
-You already have the alyout and components that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual visual styles
-Create the design based on selected website personality, the design guidelines I showed you, and inspiration (see web design section)
-Use the client's branding (it if exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: colors typography, icons, etc..

#05 - Test and optimize

-Make sure website works well in all major browsers (Chrome, firefox, Sfari, Edge, maybe even old IE)
-Test the wbesite on actual mobile devices, not just in devTools
-Optimize all images, in terms of dimensions and file size(See lecture on images)
-Fix simple accessibility problems (color contrast issues)
-Run the lighthouse performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues
-Think about Search Engine Optimization

#06 - Launch the masterpiece

-Once all works is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client (or yourself)
it's time to share your masterpiece with the world
-Upload your website files to a hosting platform. There are countless platform, we will use one with a free plan (Netlify)
-Choose and buy a great domain name, one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write

#07 - Maintain and keep updating website

-Launching is not the end
-Keep the website content updated overtime. If you're working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract (recurring revenue)
-Install analytics software (Google Analytics of Fathom) to get statistics about website users. 
This may inform future changes in the site structure and content.
-A blog that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users coming back, and is also good for SEO.
